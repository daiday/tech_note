\section{B-Spline Curve}


B-Spline curve is constructed from the three ingredients. 
\begin{itemize}
\item the degree of the polynominal basis $p$.
\item a set of $n$ control points $\{\bi{p}_0,\ldots, \bi{p}_{n-1}\}$,
\item a knot vector $\bi{u}$ of $m+1$ non-descending real number $\{u_0\le u_1 \le  u_2\ldots \le u_{m}\}$ where $m=n+p$.
\end{itemize}
%
It is a bit confusing but, if the basis is $p$ degree polynominal, the B-Spline curve is called $p+1$ order.
%
The order of the B-Spline means that up to $p+1$ control points affects a position of a point on the curve.

%
From the knot vector and $p$, we can define a basis function $N_{i,p}(u)$ which takes value in the range $u\in [u_0,u_m]$.
%
Then, the resulting equation of the curve becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\bi{p}(u) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} N_{i,p}(u)\bi{p}_i
\end{equation}


\subsection{Knot Vector}

The knot vector $\bi{u}$ defines segments on the parameter the curve.
%
This allows non-uniformly sized segments and gives the B-Spline higher degree of expression.
%
Quite frequently, the interval between knots become zero $0$ if the knot takes the same value.
%
The number of the time the knot duplicate is called \textit{knotâ€™s multiplicity}.



\subsection{Cox - De Boor's algorithm}

The basis function is defined hierarchically. 
%
In other words, we build up the basis function based on the basis function of one order lower.


We start from $0$ degree basis function which is piecewise constant over the interval
%
\begin{equation}
N_{i,0} (u)
= \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
1 & if \; u_i < u < u_{i+1} \\
0 & otherwize
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
%
Then, for $p>0$, we define the basis functions using the basis function of $p-1$ degree as
%
\begin{equation}
N_{i,p}(u) = 
\frac{u-u_{i}}{u_{i+p}-u_i} N_{i,p-1}(u)
+ 
\frac{u_{i+p+1}-u}{u_{i+p+1}-u_{i+1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(u)
\label{eqn:deboor}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:deboor_basis} show the basis functions of the B-Spline with different degrees. 
%
Please notice that, \textcolor{red}{the degree $p$ basis functions have a domain of $p+1$ intervals}.
%
So if you go up in the higher degree, the influence of a control point gets wider, meaning that the function become smoother. 
%
Further more, given a parameter $t\in [t_0,t_m]$, it will cover by up to $p+1$ basis function.
%
This means that \textcolor{red}{$p+1$ control points influence a point on the B-Spline curve}.

\label{fig:deboor_basis}
\end{figure}



Figure~\ref{fig:deboor_operation} shows that example of the B-Spline basis function construction from the basis functions of $p=1$ to one of $p=2$ using the \eqref{eqn:deboor}.
%
Starting from two neighboring basis functions we call left and right functions, we multiply a linear functions for each.
%
For the left basis function we multiply a linear function that goes from zero to one over the domain of the function. 
%
Domain of the function means where the function takes value other than zero. 
%
In this case $p=1$ functions takes two segments as the domain.
%
Similarly, we multiply the right basis function to a linear function that linearly goes down from one to zero over its domain.
%
If we multiply a linear function to $p$ degree function, we get a $p+1$ degree function. 
%
Adding up these two functions, we get a new basis. 
%
Because the left and right basis function have domains different by one segment, the new basis function gets a one segment wider.

\subsection{Knot Insertion}

We can insert a knot in the knot vector without changing the curve shape.



Let's say we insert a knot $u$ in the knot vector.
%
Because the knot values need to be monotonically increase, the $u$ need to be insert in the interval $[u_k,u_{k+1}]$ where $ u_k\le  u \le u_{k+1}$.
%
If we add one knot value, one control point need to be added (remember the relation $n=m+p$).
%
There are $p+1$ number of basis functions whose domain include $u$ are $N_{k-p,p},\ldots,N_{k,p}$.
%
Hence by the knot insertion only the corresponding control points $\bi{p}_{k-p},\ldots,\bi{p}_k$ need to be considered.

\end{figure}

De Boor's algorithm says the new control point locations are on the polyline connecting the old control points.
%
$p-1$ number of old control points $\bi{p}_{k-p+1},\ldots,\bi{p}_{k-1}$ are replaced by $p$ number of new control points $\bi{q}_{k-p+1},\ldots,\bi{q}_k$.
%
For example, the new control point $\bi{q}_i$ lies on the line segment connecting $\bi{p}_{i-1}$ and $\bi{p}_i$.  

\begin{align}
\bi{q}_i &= (1-a_i) \bi{p}_{i-1} + a_i\bi{p}_i\;\;\;\;  \; (k-p+1 \le i \le k) \\
where \;\;\; a_i      &=  \frac{u-u_i}{u_{i+p}-u_i} 
\end{align}



\subsection{Evaluation of a Point}




\section{NURBS Curve}
%
The NURBS is the abbreviation of \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{R}ational \underline{B}-\underline{S}pline curve. 
%
``non-uniform" means that the interval of the knots can be uneven. 
%
Rational means there are weight $w$ for the control points.
%
\begin{equation}
\bi{p}(u) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} N_{i,p}(u)w_i\bi{p}_i}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} N_{i,p}w_i }
\end{equation}
%
This weight gives further control ability to the curve. 


Each control points have a weight $w_i$. 
%
If all the weight is $1$ it becomes a B-Spline curve with non-uniform knot interval.
%






\subsection{How NURBS can Represent a Perfect Circle}


Let's use a homogeneous coordinate to understand how the NURBS can successfully define a perfect circle. 
%
Here we think about two dimensional space where.
%
A homogenious coordinate has additional one dimension $w$ in addition to the $xy$.
%
The point $(x,y,w)$ in homogeneous coordinate corresponds to the two dimensional point $(x/w,y/w)$.
%
Such a homogeneous coordinate is called Affine transformation and is very useful in computer graphics to define perspective transformation.
